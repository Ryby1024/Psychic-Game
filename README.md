<h1>About the Psychic Game</h1>
<ul>
<li>This project is a letter guessing game. The user tries to guess a randomly selected letter that the computer has stored. You are given 10 guesses to find the correct letter. If you are not able to correctly guess the letter, you receive an alert letting you know that you lost and what the correct letter was. The game then automatically choses a new letter an restarts the game.</li>

<li>The Psychic Game helps you to practice basic Javascript and learn assigning variables, for and if statements, as well as using functions.</li>
